    <h2>What is Kheer?</h2>
    <p>Kheer is a sweet Indian rice pudding dish. To read more about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kheer"target="_blank"><em>click here!</em></a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup rice 50 grams, I used basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ghee also known as clarified butter</li>
        <li>3-4 green cardamom pods slightly crushed</li>
        <li>1 liter whole milk</li>
        <li>4-5 tablespoons sugar 50-62.5 grams, adjust to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped nuts I used chopped cashews & almonds</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons rose water (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How do you make it?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice until water turns clear. Soak the rice in enough water for 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the rice and set aside</li>
        <li>Place a pan on medium heat.  Add 1 teaspoon of ghee to it and add rice. Add 3-4 crushed green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>Toss the rice with the ghee and cardamom for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly until aromatic</li>
        <li> Add the milk to the pan and stir well. Set heat to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Let the milk come to a boil. Stir in between so that milk doesn't stuck to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the milk has come to a boil, lower the heat to low and let the kheer cook for around 25 minutes on low heat. Stir every 2 minutes or so. The milk will reduce considerably after 25 minutes and the kheer would look thick and the rice will be completely cooked.</li>
        <li>Add in the sugar and mix. Also add in the nuts.</li>
        <li>Remove pan after 5 min. from heat. Garnish with more nuts and serve kheer warm or chilled.</li>
    </ol>
